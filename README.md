# Netdraw
The project is a console ascii art program in the same vein as David Murray's Petdraw. David (a.k.a 8-Bit Guy) uses his application for making petscii graphics for his games on old Commodore compters; the aim of this project is very similar except the target platform would be the .Net console in this case.
